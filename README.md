## Evaluating Machine Learning Methods for Event Classification in the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber
Contains code produced for my 2017-18 academic year independent research project. All results found in this work are presented in my physics honors thesis.


Algorithms tested include those available in the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package and neural
networks written using [Keras](https://keras.io/) with a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) backend.
